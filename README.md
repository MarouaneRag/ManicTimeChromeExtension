# ManicTime Chrome Extension (improved liability)

The Official ManicTime chrome extension has some serious connection issues. I tried to fix them here.

## ðŸ”ŒTo setup:

Uninstall the official extension, then:

- Go to  `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developer mode
- Click import extension and use the files [here](https://github.com/MarouaneRag/ManicTimeChromeExtension/archive/master.zip)
- Allow incognito from settings (optional)
