# ManicTime Chrome Extension

The Official **ManicTime** chrome extension (in its current version: 1.1.2) has some serious WebSocket issues that affect document reporting (url) of Google Chrome. I tried to fix them here and make it alot more reliable. I didn't change anything else.

## ðŸ”ŒTo setup:

Go to  `chrome://extensions`, then:

- Uninstall the official extension
- Enable developer mode
- Click import extension, and use the files [here](https://github.com/MarouaneRag/ManicTimeChromeExtension/archive/master.zip)
- Allow incognito from settings (optional)
